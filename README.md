# `tonioviz` to the rescue

## Prerequisites

For the moment, make sure you install:
- Pangolin
- GTSAM

and let me know if it breaks...

Then just checkout the `examples/SimpleCheckout.cpp` exec and let me know if it
runs for you.

<!-- You can install the necessary dependencies by just running the -->
<!-- `install-dependencies.sh` script. This will install: -->

<!-- - Pangolin -->

<!-- In addition, you need to have the following: -->

<!-- - GTSAM (negociable if you guys think we should remove this dependency, should -->
<!--   be pretty easy to do) -->

## Examples

Here are some examples:

- GTSAM-based:

- Eigen-based:

- ROS-based:
